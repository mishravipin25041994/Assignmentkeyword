    "a-Identifiers can only consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "b-The first character of an identifier cannot be a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Case Sensitivity:\n",
    "a-Python is case-sensitive. For example, \"myVariable\" and \"myvariable\" would be treated as different identifiers.\n",

    "3-Reserved Words:\n",
    "a-Identifiers cannot be a Python keyword or reserved word because they have specific meanings in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Length Limitation:\n",
    "a-There is no specific limit on the length of an identifier in Python, but it's good practice to keep them reasonably short and descript\n",

    "# Valid Identifiers\n",

    "4- Why is proper indentation important in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-4 \n",
    "Proper indentation in Python is crucial because it is used to define the structure and scope of code blocks. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to denote blocks of code, Python relies on indentation to indicate the beginning and end of blocks. The Python interpreter uses indentation to understand the structure of the code and determine which statements belong to a particular block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why proper indentation is important in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Readability: Indentation makes the code more readable by visually representing the logical structure of the program. It helps developers quickly understand the relationships between different parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Code Blocks: In Python, indentation is not just for aesthetics; it defines code blocks. Statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block, such as those within a loop, conditional statement, or function. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or, more importantly, alter the logic of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Consistency: Consistent indentation style across the codebase helps maintain a clean and uniform look. It's a common convention in the Python community to use four spaces for each level of indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Debugging: Proper indentation can aid in debugging by visually highlighting the structure of the code. If there are indentation errors, it becomes easier to spot issues and fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Collaboration: When working in a team, adhering to a consistent indentation style ensures that everyone can easily understand and contribute to the codebase. It reduces confusion and enhances collaboration."

    "5-What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-5-In Python, indentation plays a crucial role in defining the structure and scope of code blocks. If indentation is incorrect or inconsistent, it can lead to various issues, including syntax errors and logical errors in the program. Here are some consequences of incorrect indentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Syntax Errors: The most common issue is a syntax error. Python uses indentation to determine the beginning and end of blocks of code, such as those within loops, conditional statements, and functions. If the indentation is not correct, Python will raise a IndentationError indicating that there is a problem with the code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Logical Errors: Even if the code runs without syntax errors, incorrect indentation can lead to logical errors. Statements that are meant to be part of a specific block may execute inappropriately or may not be executed at all, leading to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Misleading Code Structure: Incorrect indentation can mislead developers about the intended structure of the code. This can make the code harder to read, understand, and maintain.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans- An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a combination of variables, literals, operators, and function calls. Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or as complex as a mathematical formula or function invocation.\n",
